# Terrain Shooter 
Terrain Shooter is a multiplayer browser game where the players battle on terrain, which changes every round. The terrain is generated with perlin noise making it naturally random. I used a drawing library called p5.js for drawing everything in the screen, and node.js for server code. This was my first multiplayer project that i made.
